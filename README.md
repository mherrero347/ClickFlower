# ClickFlower - Music 256A - Homework 2

ClickFlower is a simple GUI-based instrument which plays a Faust-generated sine oscillator. To use ClickerFlower, the user simply clicks on a place within the flower box, and a flower will appear! The position of the flower influences the qualities of the sound; a flower in the top-right corner of the screen will be the loudest and highest frequency, a flower in the bottom-left corner of the screen will be the softest and lowest frequency (vertical mapping to frequency, horizontal to gain). The flower follows wherever the user clicks, and will change is sound accordingly.

For a video demo of the app, watch this: https://youtu.be/0E0eTLNmtOo
